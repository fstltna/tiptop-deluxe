===================================
2.0 TROUBLESHOOTING / COMPATIBILITY
===================================

For updates to this list go to www.popcap.com.

2.1  DirectX®

TipTop requires you to have DirectX 7 drivers or better installed.
These are sound and video drivers from Microsoft used in
many games. If you need the latest version of DirectX, go to
http://www.microsoft.com/directx.

2.2  Screen Color Depth

TipTop requires you to be running in 16bit color or better. It
may not function in Windowed mode properly in 256 colors. If you
are running in 256 colors, the game will try to switch to full
screen mode.

In addition, the game may run slowly in windowed mode in 32 bit
color. If this occurs, switch to full-screen mode, or change
your color depth to 16 bits.

2.3  Bug Reporting

Though we've tried our best to squash all the bugs, every once in
a while something we didn't expect pops up...

If you should come across a bug in TipTop, please report it to
bugs@popcap.com.


===================
3.0 GETTING STARTED
===================

3.1 GOAL

The goal of TipTop is to match 3 or more similar game blocks together.
Clear away enough blocks and advance to the next level!

3.2 GAME TYPES

After the game loads, you will see a screen allowing you to choose
Regular mode, Strategy mode, or Speed mode. If you have a saved game,
you will also see the option to continue that saved game. 

* REGULAR MODE

This is the mode you will be familiar with if you have played the web 
version. In Regular mode, you may select where you drop the falling game 
blocks (these are the blocks at the top of the game screen that fall down). 
But you have no control over where the next floating block will pop up 
(these are the blocks that appear at the bottom of the game screen and 
float up).

There is no time limit in Regular mode.

When you quit out of Regular mode, your game will automatically be
saved. You may continue it by clicking 'Continue Saved Game'. Only one 
game may be saved at any one time.

* STRATEGY MODE

This mode is only available in the Deluxe version. Strategy mode is a slower 
paced game where you can control the position of either the falling or the 
floating block each turn, but not both at the same time. Tip: Pay special 
attention to the floating blocks!

When you quit out of Strategy mode, your game will automatically be
saved. You may continue it by clicking 'Continue Saved Game'. Only one 
game may be saved at any one time.

* SPEED MODE

Speed mode offers a drastic change of pace from the other modes. It is similar 
to Regular mode in that you control only the placement of the falling blocks, 
but the floating blocks float up every few seconds, regardless of whether you 
have dropped a block or not. Each level gets a little faster!


================
4.0 INSTRUCTIONS
================

4.1 CONTROLS

TipTop is controlled entirely with the mouse. Select where you wish to drop a 
block by moving your mouse over the columns. Click your left mouse button to 
drop the block. 

You may also use the keyboard to control the game. Use the directional right 
and left arrow keys to position your block in the desired column, and then use 
the 'D' key to drop the block.

4.2 GAMEPLAY

Drop blocks to make matches of three or more. When a match is made, those 
blocks are cleared and all the blocks above fall down to take the place of the 
cleared blocks. If you make more than one match at a time, you can earn a combo 
bonus. On the right hand side of the screen is the Level Bar - this fills up as 
you earn points. When it is full, you move up to the next level.

You will lose the game if any column reaches the top or bottom of the 
playfield.
  

4.3 SPECIAL BLOCKS
There are five Special Blocks in the game.
Magnet: This pulls a column up one row.
Anvil: This pushes a column down one row.
Joker: Matches the block it is dropped on.
Color Bomb: Removes ALL blocks of the type it is dropped on.
Column Bomb: Removes an entire column.

4.7 BONUS LEVEL

After every 3 levels, you'll get a chance at the Bonus Round!
Don't worry, you can't lose the game here...just try to make as many points
as you can!

===========
5.0 MENU OPTIONS
===========

You can access various options for TipTop Deluxe from the Options button 
on the sidebar, or from the Main Menu.

5.1 MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS 

You can raise or lower the volume for either of these independently
by moving the respective slider. To turn music or sound off, move
the slider all the way to the left.

5.2 FULLSCREEN MODE 

You can play TipTop in either windowed or full-screen mode. To 
toggle between the two, click on the checkbox next to Fullscreen.

You may see faster performance in full-screen mode, depending on
your system.

5.3 TIPS 

Unchecking this will disable the hints that automatically appear when you 
during the game.

==================
6.0 REGISTRATION
==================

If you enjoy playing the Trial version of TipTop, sooner or later
you'll need to register!

6.1 BENEFITS OF REGISTERING

When you register, it removes all the annoying nags from the loading
screen, and unlocks your copy of TipTop so you can play it as often
as you like! 

6.2 HOW TO REGISTER

To unlock the game, you need to buy a registration code online, and then
enter it into TipTop.

6.3  BUY A REGISTRATION CODE ONLINE

If you're playing TipTop, click on the OPTIONS button on the sidebar and
then click REGISTER. A dialog will come up onscreen. Click the REGISTER ONLINE
link to launch your web browser. You'll need to have an active internet connection!

You can also register via the web. Go to:
 http://www.popcap.com/register.php?theGame=TipTop
and click the Registration link.

Once you're there, follow the directions on the web site to purchase your
registration code. You can use your credit card online to buy it, or fax your
purchase in, or send a money order.

When complete, you will be given a registration code (a 20-character sequence
of letters and numbers) keyed to your name. Don't give this to anyone else! 

You will also receive a copy sent to your email address. You should write down 
your registration code in case you ever have a computer crash or need to reinstall
TipTop for some other reason.

6.4  ENTER YOUR REGISTRATION CODE

You must launch TipTop to enter your registration code. Once the game comes up,
click on the REGISTER link on the loading screen, or from the OPTIONS menu.

A dialog will come up with space for you to enter your name and registration code.
Type these in carefully! If you make a mistake, your code may not be recognized. 

The easiest way to do this is to cut and paste the code from the email you were
sent, by highlighting the 20-digit number with your mouse, pressing ctrl-c to copy
the text, and then pressing the Paste button (or ctrl-v) to paste it into the 
registration dialog in TipTop.

Be sure to use the same name you gave when you bought your registration code
online, or your registration may not be recognized. 

Once you've entered your name and registration code, click OK and your copy of 
TipTop should now be registered. You will have full access to all the game's
features, with no delay at the loading screen!

6.5 PROBLEMS?

If the program doesn't seem to recognize your registration code, check carefully
that you've typed it in correctly. Using the cut-and-paste method described above
can help prevent mistakes. Also make sure you're using the same name you used to
register with.

If you can't get to the online registration site to buy your registration code, 
make sure your internet connection is working properly. You must be connected to
the internet. If it still doesn't work, check back in a little while to see if
there was a temporary problem with our servers.

Lost your registration code? Email us at feedback@popcap.com or go to
www.popcap.com/support.php and we'll try to recover it for you. Make sure to let
us know the name of the game you bought, the name you purchased it under, and 
the approximate date of purchase... this'll make it a lot easier for us to search
our records. 

However, no PopCap employee will EVER ask you for your registration code or your
credit card number. 

Don't have a credit card, or don't want to enter it online? You can choose to fax
your credit card number in, or send a money order instead, by selecting the 
appropriate option on the Payment Method selector on the web page.

Hopefully this will answer all your questions, but if you're still having
difficulties, feel free to contact us at feedback@popcap.com. Include as much
information as you can about the problem you're having, and we'll get back to
